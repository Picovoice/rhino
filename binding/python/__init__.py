    represents the set of expressions (spoken commands), intents, and intent arguments (slots) within a domain of
    interest.

    location.
    :param sensitivity: Inference sensitivity. It should be a number within [0, 1]. A higher sensitivity value
    results in fewer misses at the cost of (potentially) increasing the erroneous inference rate.
