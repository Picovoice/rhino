 * from spoken commands within a given domain of interest in real-time. It processes incoming audio
 * in consecutive frames (chunks) and at the end of each frame indicates if the intent inference is
 * finalized. When finalized, the intent can be retrieved as structured data in form of an intent
 * string and pairs of slots and values representing arguments (details) of intent. The number of
 * samples per frame can be attained by calling {@link #frameLength()}. The incoming audio needs to
 * have a sample rate equal to {@link #sampleRate()} and be 16-bit linearly-encoded. Furthermore,
 * Rhino operates on single channel audio.
