# Rhino iOS Demo

## AccessKey

Rhino requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Rhino SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

## Running the Demo

Before building the demo app, run the following from this directory to install the Rhino CocoaPods:
```ruby
pod install
```
Open `RhinoDemo.xcworkspace` and run the demo.

Copy your `AccessKey` into the `ACCESS_KEY` variable in `RhinoDemo/ContentView.swift` before building the demo.

The default context for this demo is `Smart Lighting`. Simply press start, and the engine can recognize commands such as

> Turn off the lights.

or

> Set the lights in the bedroom to blue.

See below for the full context:
