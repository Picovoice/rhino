# Rhino Flutter Demo

To run the Rhino demo on Android or iOS with Flutter, you must have the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your system. Once installed, you can run `flutter doctor` to determine any other missing requirements for your relevant platform. Once your environment has been set up, launch a simulator or connect an Android/iOS device. 

## AccessKey

Rhino requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Rhino SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

## Usage

Replace your `AccessKey` in [lib/main.dart](lib/main.dart) file:

```dart
final String accessKey = "{YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE}"; // AccessKey obtained from Picovoice Console (https://console.picovoice.ai/)
```

Before launching the app, use the copy_assets.sh script to copy the rhino demo context file into the demo project. (**NOTE**: on Windows, Git Bash or another bash shell is required, or you will have to manually copy the context into the project.).

Run the following command from [demo/flutter](../../demo/flutter) to build and deploy the demo to your device:
```console
flutter run
```

The default context for this demo is `Smart Lighting`. Simply press start, and the engine can recognize commands such as

> Turn off the lights.

or

> Set the lights in the bedroom to blue.

See below for the full context:
