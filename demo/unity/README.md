# Rhino Unity Demo 

The Rhino demo for Unity is a multi-platform demo that runs on:

- Desktop Standalone (Windows, macOS and Linux x86_64)
- iOS 9.0+
- Android 4.1+

Additionally, you will need a version of Unity that is 2017.4 or higher.

## AccessKey

Rhino requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Rhino SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

## Usage

Replace the `AccessKey` in [`RhinoDemo.cs`](RhinoDemo.cs) with the `AccessKey` obtained above:

```csharp
private const string ACCESS_KEY = "${YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE}"; // AccessKey obtained from Picovoice Console (https://console.picovoice.ai/)
```

The easiest way to run the demo is to simply import the [Rhino Unity package](../../binding/unity/rhino-2.1.4.unitypackage) into your project, open the RhinoDemo scene and hit play. To run on other platforms or in the player, go to _File > Build Settings_, choose your platform and hit the `Build and Run` button.

Once the demo launches, press the `Start Listening` button, and you can say anything in the smart lighting context:
