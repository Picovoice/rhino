The PyPrind (Python Progress Indicator) module provides a progress
bar and a percentage indicator
object that let you track the progress of a loop structure or
other iterative computation.
Typical applications include the processing of
large data sets to provide an intuitive estimate
at runtime about the progress of the computation.

For more details and examples please see the package documentation
https://github.com/rasbt/pyprind/blob/master/README.md.
