    #[Rhino](https://github.com/Picovoice/rhino).   
    It supports Linux (x86_64), Mac (x86_64), Raspberry Pi (Zero, 1, 2, 3, 4), and BeagleBone.
    ## Installation
    ```bash
    pip install pvrhino
    ```
    If it fails to install PyAudio, you can do the following for Debian/Ubuntu as referenced in the installation guide
    of [PyAudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/). 
    Install PyAudio  
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio
    ```
    If the above fails then first run the following
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
    sudo apt-get install python-all-dev python3-all-dev
    ```
    ## Usage
    ### Realtime Demo
    Make sure you have a working microphone connected to your device first. From commandline type the following
    ```bash
    pvrhino_mic
    ```
    Then start with "Hey Pico" and order coffee. The demo infers intent from spoken commands in the context of a coffee maker 
    and initializes the Porcupine engine to detect the wake phrase _Hey Pico_. When the wake phrase is detected,
    Rhino starts processing the follow-up spoken command and prints out the inferred intent and slot values to the console.

    In order to get more information about using demos, run them with '--help' argument or look into their GitHub page
    [here](https://github.com/Picovoice/rhino/tree/master/demo/python).
    ### Rhino Class

    You can create an instance of Rhino engine for use within your application using the factory method provided below.
    ```python
    import pvrhino
    context_file_path= # The file is available under resources/contexts/
    pvrhino.create(context_file_path)
    ```
    If the `context_file_path` is not provided, the default context is the coffee maker.
